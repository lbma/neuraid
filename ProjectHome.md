We plan to investigate the creation of a software system that is capable of reading Electroencephalography (EEG) information from users while they are interacting with mobile applications. The collected data will then be analyzed to detect when and where the user was alternately comfortable and frustrated with the use of the application. Through our research, we plan to learn ways to improve the user interfaces of mobile applications based on EEG data. In particular on mobile devices, optimizing the user interface is essential for increasing user engagement with an application.
